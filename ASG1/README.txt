Instructions for running this project:

Running 'make run' in the terminal will compile and execute the program.
By default, the program will run all the tests.
All functions are implimented as per the assignment.
They are all standalone functions, and do not require helper functions 
or external libraries (excluding printf).

Note that the testing functions require external libraries for use of
printf and malloc.

Makefile instructions:

-make:          compile the program (run './a.out' to run)
-make run:      compile and run the program
-make debug:    compile with degugger flags (for gdb)
